# gnn_paper_plot_code

This repository contains the code required to reproduce the current paper plots.

All scripts rely on .csv-files containing retro, gnn and truth variables. These are available on cobalt at:  /data/user/rorsoe/paper_data

Note:
Computing classification and performance plots is quick.
Computing robustness plots directly from the raw .csv-files takes a long time. Therefore, a summary df containing the derived statistics is included here together with the code that produceses it. You may alter it as you wish.
